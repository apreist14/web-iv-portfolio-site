         <p>Hello! My name is Ashley Preister. I am a small town farm girl born and raised in Lindsay, Nebraska. I have filled my life with happiness that percolates from my heart. I fell in love with photography and design. The joy and fulfillment I receive in creating meaningful images and creations compares to nothing else. If you are looking for someone to work with or if you just want to say “Hello!,” feel free to get in touch!</p>
         <p>I am most interested in the areas of typography, photography, and print, but I also thrive off the opportunity to explore new things within the design world. I am a quick learner, adaptable and approachable with determination to complete any task I take on.</p>
